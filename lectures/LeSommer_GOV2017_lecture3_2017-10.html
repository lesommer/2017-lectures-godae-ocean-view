# Lecture #1 
## Ocean circulations models : scope, usage and fundamentals.

*Ocean circulation models *


 - are based on **first principle physics**;

 - are used for a **wide range of applications**;

 - are a key **building block of operational oceanography**;

 - require **group effort and collaborations** over long time scales. 

*We have also learned that :* 

 - **subgrid closures are rate controling** components of ocean models; 

 - **numerical discretization is a key** aspect of ocean circulation modelling; 

 - besides the numerical kernel, **interfaces are also important** (forcing function, coupling interfaces, etc...)

 - ocean models are now (arguably) **able to describe mesoscale motions at global scale**;  

 - new frontier :  **submesoscale-permitting modelling at global scale**. 


---
class: left

# Lecture #2
## Representation of physical processes ocean circulation models

 - ocean circulation models are **continuously increasing the range of physical processes** they account for; 
 
 -  but defining objectively **what fraction of ocean variability is adequately represented** in ocean model solution is difficult; 

 - the **notion of effective resolution** is a simple (simplistic ?) concept that serves as a rationale for separating resolved and unresolved scales in ocean models; 

 - Interaction with **computer scientist and applied mathematicians will be essential** to further increasing the range of scale resolved in ocean models (schemes, HPC, ...)

 - the design of **SGS closures is a key activity** of ocean model design but (1) this is not an easy task (2) the problem is not that well posed (average ?, LES, RANS ? ) 
 
 - the **coupling with third party models** is likely to become a natural way for ocean circulation model to account for certain classes of physical processes

# Part 1.
# Stochastic modelling in ocean circulation models



---
class: left
# Beyond deterministic subgrid scales closures


--

The **SGS closure problem** :  estimating a good model $\mathcal{M} (\, \overline{\mathbf{s}}) = \mathcal{N} (\, \overline{\mathbf{s}}) - \overline{\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{s})}$. 

--

 - as discuused, assuming that you can **draw a local deterministic model** that is fully asserved to resolved scales of motions is very strong assumption.

 - physically your are assuming that the **net result of micro-states at macro-scale** is not dependent on the micro-scales. 

--

but a number of recent works have started to reconsider this assumption.

--

 - these approaches allow the closure to be only weakly constrained by the resolved scale. 

--

 - a certain amont of **randomness is introduced with a stochastic procedure** to account for the possible varibility of fluxes at macroscales


--

 - Stochastic parameterizations seem in particular well suited to the representation of **the cross scale exchanges of energy and momentum** for SGS balanced turbulence (in particular energy backscatter)

--

 - notable improvment of Gulf stream dynamics have also been obtained through the stochastic representation of the upscaling due to the **nonlinear equation of state**

#  Potential wells and marginal stability

There is actually **another rationale that supports this idea of introducing random perturbation** in ocean models. 

--

.center[
<img style="width:80%"  src="../figures/pot-well.png" >]


The idea is that **perturbations could allow your system to escape from local potential wells** and therefore explore more reliably the range of possible states. 



---
class: left
#  Range of applications of stochastic ocean modelling 

Stochastic approaches are therefore not limited to the representation of subgrid processes, they have been suceesfully applied to account for : 

 - the **uncertainty** in sea ice model parameters

 - the **uncertainty** in biogeochemical models parameters

# Part 2.
# Uncertainty in ocean circulation modelling



---
class: left
#  Multiple sources of uncertainty in ocean models
&nbsp;


 - ocean model solutions are affected by **several sources of errors** that combine and interact. 

--

 - ocean model solutions are affected by **errors in their initial condition** : this is patricularly true at depth; 


--

 - ocean model solutions are affected by **errors in the forcing function** : uncertain atmospheric fields, uncertain parameter in bulk formula...

--

 - ocean model solutions are affected by **errors associated with subgrid closures** : closures are imperfect models, with usually weakly constrained parameters

--

 - ocean model solutions are affected by **the physical approximation**  use in for their continuous formulation : eg. non-traditional Coriolis terms

--

 - ocean model solutions are affected by **numerical discretization errors** : even high order schemes have non-zero errors, these errors cumulate in time. 

--

.center[
Overall, **uncertainty is a major property of ocean circulation models** that physicist tend to neglect to often.

#  The complex nature of numerical discretization errors


&nbsp;

 - numerical discretization errors can be classified in two categories : 

<img style="width:33%"  src="../figures/diss-error.png" >
**dissipative errors affect the amplitude**


<img style="width:33%"  src="../figures/disp-error.png" >
**dispersion errors affect the phase of the solution**

&nbsp;

- numerical discretization errors may **propagate spatially** in the solution 

- numerical discretization errors may **accumulate over time**

&nbsp;

.center[
 after integration over long times, **numerical discretization errors can have complex patterns**.

#  Practical expression of errors in ocean model solution 

.center[
(Melet et al.)
<img style="width:90%"  src="../figures/s-bias.png"> 
]

&nbsp;


 - In practice, ocean model error manifest itself through the **time-mean state** of the model solution, its **trend** at its **variability** at all time scale.

 - Model errors are also usually **correlated both in space and in time** (see above). 

 - Model error is usually due to a combination of different factors

---
class: left
#  Example 1 : the phase of mesoscale eddy variability 

<img style="width:100%"  src="../figures/arbic2.png" >


 - the phase of mesoscale variability is obvioulsy not predicted by forced, non-assimilated ocean models. 

 - but implicitely, it is tempting to think that the phase of  mesoscale flow feature is not affecting too much the low frequency variability. 
   
 - Arbic et al. (2012) have shown that energy cascades in time too long time scale so that the phase of mesoscale may actually affect long time scales...
---
class: left
#  Example 2: AMOC in forced ocean models

<img style="width:100%"  src="../figures/behrens.png" >

- A key prediction that is expected from ocean models is **how the atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) varies** in time. 

- Behrens et al. (2013) have shown that although the interannual variability of the AMOC is rather predictable, **surface salinity restoring is a major control** of the decadal trend of AMOC.

---
class: left
#  Multimodality of ocean states

.center[
<img style="width:80%"  src="../figures/pot-well.png" >]

 - The **topology of the phase space of non-linear system** can be rather complicated, possible showing muliple possible local energy minima. 

--

 - Deshayes et al. (2013) found in a global model that the freshwater transport in the southern atlantic was such that the **AMOC  could be unstable to forcing perturbations**. *but can we trust this model prediction ?*

#  Intrinsic ocean chaos revealed by ensemble simulation 


The OCCIPUT ensemble of global eddying ocean model solutions 

.center[
<img style="width:100%"  src="../figures/occiput.png" >]

this set of simulation allows to investigate wjat fraction of oceanic variability is **governed by the atmosphere** versus the spontaneous **variability due to oceanic chaos**


see the posters by **Stephanie Leroux** and **Ixetl GarcÄ±a Gomez**.

#  Benefits of ensemble simulation 


Ensemble modelling not only allows to tackles specific questions regarding oceanic variability but also : 

--

 - is a very good strategy in terms of HPC : ensemble runs avec 100% scallable ! 

--
 
 - more generally probabilistic ocean modelling (ensemble + stochastic) allow to combine nicely data driven and physics driven approaches (see later)

--

 - therefore allowing ocean modellers to discuss more happily with data assimilation experts. 

--

 - most importantly, ensemble modelling allows allows for a more objective comparison of model solutions with observations.

--

example :  Rank histograms and model reliability

.center[
<img style="width:90%"  src="../figures/rank.png" >]

.center[ 
the set of ensemble member  values  at  a  given  point  and  the  true state  ought to be able to be considered random samples from the same probability distribution.

#  A system approach to ocean modelling



--

<img style="width:100%"  src="../figures/system-multi-modality.png" >


--

 - dealing more objectively with **model uncertainty** through a combination of **ensemble and stochastic methods**

--

 - allowing to **explicitely sample  the distribution  of possible states** given explicitely formulated uncertainties (Bayesian approach)

--
.center[
*arguably a paradigm shift in ocean circulation modelling ?* 
]

--

 - but still unclear how to deal with the **daemon of dimensionality** (sampling a 10$^n$ degrees of freedom pdf with 50 members...)

# Part 4.
# Towards data-driven ocean modelling


---
class: left
#  The changing usage of geoscientific data


 - as we all know the **flow of geoscientific data** is increasing at an accelerating rate

--

- this is true for **observational data** due to new satellite missions with increase downlink capacity, and evolution of in-situ networks. SWOT mission :  360 Mb/s versus 30kb/s for conventional altimeters

--

- this is also true for **model data** with increase model resolution at higher temporal sampling. Basin to global scale submesoscale permitting model produce 100s Tb of data. 

--

- sure, this implies that **in our scientific studies**, we use larger and larger dataset; 

--

- this also motivates the design innovative data-mining strategies and **data analysis pipelines**

--

- several scientific fields have experienced **strong paradigm shifts** due to similar transitions over the last 10 years : genomics, neurosciences, and arguably social sciences.

#  How do ocean modellers use observationnal data ? (1/2)


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

--

 - Observational data are used for constraining ocean model **initial states**. in practice, it is becoming more common to initialize models with ocean reanalysis (ex: NATL60) 

--

 - Observational data are used for constraining ocean model **forcing functions at the surface**; this is based on satellite data and atmospheric reanalysis data (not technically speaking observations)


--

 - after running their simulations, ocean modellers **assess their model solutions** with observational data; (how seriously they do it often depend on reviewers...)

--

-  Observational data may also be used **for designing subgrid closures** and/or **assessing the representation of physical processes** in ocean models. 



--
.center[
**But overall, usages of observational data are pretty straighforward. **
]


---
class: left
#  How do ocean modellers use observational data ? (2/2)


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


we can also observe the emergence of new usages which bridge from ocean modelling to data-assimilation : 
 
--

 - **parameters of subgrid closures** can be adjusted through with approaches from data assimilation (Wirth and verron)

--
 
 - the **parameters of bulk formulae** can be adjusted using observational data with data assimilation (Meinvielle et al.)
  
--

 - **increments from data assimilation schemes** used in ocean reanalysis can be used for better understanding the origin and nature of ocean model bias. 

--

.center[
**Arguably, ocean model design and usage is gradually using more methods comig from data science.**]

#  Data-driven design of subgrid scale closures 

.center[
<img style="width:75%"  src="../figures/vollant.png" >
]

 - Several groups in **fluid dynamics** have sucessfully designed SGS closures with data driven techniques, namely methods adapted to **find regularities and correlation in large datasets** : 
 
    - Vollant et al (2017) : LES closures through machine-learning
    - Ling et al. (2016) : RANS modelling using deep neural networks

--

 - some cloud micro-physics closures have already been designed from LES simulations using  data-driven approaches. 

--

 - There has been several attempts for designing SGS closures for ocean models with data-driven approaches, so far unsuccesfully.

# Lecture #3
## Towards data-driven, probabilistics ocean circulation models

--

Here we have

--

 -  illustrated several aspect of the ill-posed nature of deterministic geoscienctific modelling. 

--

 - shown (*said*) that **stochastic closures are a promising approach for reducing ocean circulation models bias**

--

 - shown that **stochastic modelling actually allows to generically deal with various sources of uncertainties** inherent to ocean models 

--

 - discussed how ensemble simulations can help **understanding the drivers of low frequency oceanic variability**

--

 - advocated that the **Bayesian framework** allows to consider  ocean circulation models for what they actually are, namely **probabilistic models of possible states of the ocean**. 

--

 - asked whether **ocean circulation model development** will be more **data-driven** in the future.
