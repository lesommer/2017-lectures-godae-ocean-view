# New frontiers for ocean circulation models. 


## what are ocean circulation models, how we develop them, how we use them

grids. 
physically based closures. 

but things have changed. 

## towards multiresolution/multiphysics ocean modelling
 now focus on interfaces between different physical models. 

 - kilometric resolution and below, interface between resolution.
 - interface with non-hydrostatic models
 - atmospheric forcing versus atmospheric coupling

it is here, active research. 

## towards probabilistic ocean modelling
 the problem is ill posed. 
 model are uncertain as obs data are. 
 think of models as a source of data. 

it is emerging

## data-driven development of ocean circulation models. 
 - how to use data for designing ocean circulation models ? 
 	example : pendulum. 
 	stochastic downscaling, models a la Fablet. 
	example : relative versus absolute from obs.

 - how we use models for developping models
	zanna.

it is the future. 

question : how to build a physical understanding ? 

## open-data, data mining and reproducibility in ocean modelling
ecosystem. 
conditions for this to occur. 
questioning the models. 
too complex.
