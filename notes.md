# New frontiers for ocean circulation models. 


## what are ocean circulation models, how we develop them, how we use them

but things have changed. 

## towards multiresolution/multiphysics ocean modelling
 now focus on interfaces between different physical models. 

 - kilometric resolution and below. 
 - atmospheric forcing versus atmospheric coupling

## towards probabilistic ocean modelling
 the problem is ill posed. 

## data-driven development of ocean circulation models. 
 - how to use data for designing ocean circulation models ? 

## open-data and reproducibility in ocean modelling
